# Project Details

Use the [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/#list-your-repositories) to get a list of repositories for a user and list them on a web page.

**Bonus:** Display the last three commits for each repository below it.

## Considerations

- How many repositories will you list? All of them, or a just the last few?
