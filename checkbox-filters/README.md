# Project Details

Write a script that filters songs from a playlist by genre and whether or not the song is Grammy-nominated (fake data).

Dynamically create checkboxes to filter songs with using the data attributes in the `#playlist`. Only show songs that match the selected checklist criteria.

**Bonus:** Give users the ability to toggle all genres.
