# Project Details

Write a script that lazy loads images as the user scrolls down the page.

The template contains `figure` elements with the `[data-image]` attribute on
them and a URL for the image file. They also optionally contain a
`[data-caption]` attribute with caption text.

## Considerations

- How do you make a specific tab active by default?
