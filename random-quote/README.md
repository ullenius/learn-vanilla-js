# Project Details

Write a script that gets a random quote from an API and renders it into the DOM.

Not sure what API to use? I like the [Ron Swanson Quotes
API](https://github.com/jamesseanwright/ron-swanson-quotes).

## Considerations

- What do you do if the quote API fails?
- How do you protect yourself from XSS attacks with third-party API data?

## Need help?

This project is part of the [Vanilla JS Academy](https://vanillajsacademy.com).
