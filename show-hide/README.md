# Project Details

Write a script that can be used to show/hide content (like the `#pirate-speak`
element in the template) when users click a button.

## Considerations

- Should the button be part of the initial markup, or created with JavaScript?
- How would someone using a screen reader know what content goes with the
button?

## Need help?

This project is part of the [DOM Manipulation pocket guide and video
