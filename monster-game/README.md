# Project Details

Build a game inspired by the movie Monsters, Inc. and loosely based on the old
PC game Minesweeper.

Create a three-by-four grid of 12 doors. When the user clicks a door, they'll
find one of their monster friends. But behind one door is a human sock. These
are dangerous and should be avoided at all costs. Finding it means you lose the
game.

If the user finds all 11 monster friends without stumbling onto the sock, they
win!

*__Note:__ SVG files for the monsters, sock, and door have been included for
you.*

## Considerations

- How are you going to render the game markup?
- How will you figure out when someone has found all of the monsters?
- What will you show when they win? What about when they lose?
- Will you offer people a chance to play again? If so, how?
