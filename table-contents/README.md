# Project Details

Write a script that generates a table of contents from the headings in a
document.

## Considerations

- Which heading levels should you use?
- Should you only use one heading level, or provide a deep, nested table of
contents?
- Should you like to items in the document or not?
- If a heading doesn't have an ID, how can you link to it?
